#Tuple : a bulit data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values

#immutable : which means we cannot change the values\

#Difference between list and tuple
 #list is mutable
 #tuple is immutable
 #list uses [] brackets
 #tuple uses () brackets
 #tuple is faster than list
 #tuple uses less memeory than list

list = [1,2,3,4,5]

tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)

print (type(tuple))
print(tuple[1])
print(tuple[4])
#tuple(2)= 10 #gives error as tuple is immutable
